# Python Lexer and Parser

Welcome to the Python Lexer and Parser repository! This project is dedicated to creating a lexer and parser for a mini-language using Python, without relying on external libraries like 're'.

## Overview

This repository contains a custom lexer and parser designed to interpret a simplified programming language. The project is implemented in Python 3.10, leveraging the match case feature. It's an excellent resource for learning about lexical analysis and parsing in compiler design.

## Features

- **Custom Lexer**: A lexer that tokenizes input based on predefined rules, without using regular expressions.
- **Custom Parser**: A parser that analyzes the tokenized input to understand its structure and syntax.
- **Mini-Language Syntax**: A defined syntax for a mini-language, including basic programming constructs like variables, conditionals, and loops.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error handling to manage illegal characters and syntax errors.
- **Example Programs**: Sample programs in the mini-language to demonstrate the lexer and parser in action.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
3. Navigate to the 'Python Mini-Language' directory.
4. Run `main.py` to execute the lexer and parser on the provided examples.
